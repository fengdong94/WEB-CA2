                It all started as a dream. A dream, not only full of cream and
                sugar — but one like a real, real dream. Like one born inside of
                our Grandmother's heart. My Grandma was born to bake, she spent
                years of her life creating and improving recipes that delighted
                both eyes and taste of anyone that would try it. I grew up with
                the sweet cinnamon smell on every Sunday afternoon — with the
                sound of the mixer my grandmother's love pouring into the batter
                — more love than flour. When her health asked for a break, we
                decided to carry on with her legacy : following her recipes,
                layer by layer, with love of a Granny and a spoon in hand.
                Today, Cakezilla is our way to keep our Grandma's memory alive,
                with a pinch of nostalgia and joy in slices. Because here, cake
                is never just a cake. It is a hug, it is a celebration, it is
                legacy and it is all about Grandma. From our Kitchen to your
                heart! Cakezilla team

                  Each recipe carries a bit of tradition from those who came
                  before us, with flavors that have crossed generations and
                  borders.

                  Each layer is made with love with a pinch of sugarzilla - just
                  the way we like it

                  There is no such a thing as standard cake here. Each design is
                  created to tell a story and express a feeling.
